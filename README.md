# Calendar
A simple XML and PHP based calendar system for displaying upcoming events (like concerts). Has a simple MySQL database setup for creating users and allowing them to login to add concerts. I hope that small music scenes might find this to be a useful tool for displaying concerts happening.

This repository contains code from the Twitter BOOTSTRAP codebase, from the PHP-login minimal project, and from coder David Jensenius.

The following resources were used when I was haphazardly putting this together.
