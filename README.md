# Calendar
A simple XML and PHP based calendar system for displaying upcoming events (like concerts). Has a simple MySQL database setup for creating users and allowing them to login to add concerts. I hope that small music scenes might find this to be a useful tool for displaying concerts happening. To see this calendar in action go to [http://cal.uncertaintymusic.com](http://cal.uncertaintymusic.com)

This repository contains code from the Twitter BOOTSTRAP codebase, from the [PHP-login minimal project](https://github.com/panique/php-login-minimal), and from coder [David Jensenius](https://github.com/djensenius).

The following resources were used when I was haphazardly putting this together.
